# Data Science, AI and other projects portfolio

This is a collection of projects that I have worked on. The projects are organized by folders, each containing a different project. The projects are written in Python and use libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, among others.
The goal is also to explore Support Vector Machines (SVMs) such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, Neural Networks, and other Machine Learning algorithms.
