## Introduction

These studies initially began as an opportunity to learn about Data Science and AI while enhancing my coding abilities. My decision was motivated by a desire to immerse myself in data analysis, a field of personal interest, and to leverage these newfound skills in practical settings. Ultimately, I aim to contribute positively to society by uncovering insights that can benefit us all.

## Features

This project is a work in progress, with additional modules planned as I continue to advance. The goal is to continue studying Data Science and Machine Learning.
