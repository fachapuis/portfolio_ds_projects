# Module 1: Data Wrangling with Python

## Sprint 2: Data Processing with NumPy and Pandas

## Part 5: Soundtrack analysis

### Overview

The goal of this project, is to analyze of soundtracks dataset. To perform this analysis, some concepts about Data Analysis, Linear Algebra, NumPy, and Pandas will be applied.

### Installation

For the porpose of this project, a jupyter notebook will be used, named _"analysis.ipynb"_, in which will be possible to find all the answers for this part. The notebook is located in the _"analytical"_ folder.

### Usage

To use this notebook, you can download it and open it with Jupyter Notebook website, or from your IDE, you can install the Jupyter notebook extension and open it from there.

### Requirements

To proper use this notebook, you will need to have installed the following libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`. If you don't have them installed, you can install them by running the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Code checking

To proper adjust code to be compliant with PEP8, the [pycodestyle_magic](https://github.com/mattijn/pycodestyle_magic?tab=readme-ov-file) was used. To install it, run the following command:

```bash
pip install flake8 pycodestyle_magic
```
